        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We live in unfortunate times. Donald Trump was elected as a “Peace and Prosperity” candidate, and only a few months into his presidency he has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-there-will-be-bombing-if-iran-does-not-make-nuclear-deal-2025-03-30/">stoked the flames of war with Iran</a> and implemented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-trade.html">disastrous economic policies</a>.</p>
        <p>In a previous post, I already detailed the math behind why tariffs damage the nation that imposes them. The summary is that tariffs necessarily lower aggregate demand in the domestic economy, and thus are always recessionary.</p>
        <p>Recently, many people have attempted to insert nuance into the tariff discussion, when none is merited. 2+2 equals 4. There isn’t any reasonable debate. This isn’t controversial, tariffs are terrible for the economy.</p>

        <h2>Facts About Tariffs</h2>
        <p>Here are a couple statistics to demonstrate how terrible tariffs actually are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In 2018, the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets asked economists of various political persuasions if, “new US tariffs on steel and aluminum will improve Americans’ welfare.” Weighted by each expert’s confidence, 100% disagreed.</li>
          <li>Researchers examined 151 countries with tariffs across 50 years and found that “tariff increases are associated with an economically and statistically sizeable and persistent decline in output growth.” Notably, the detrimental effects of tariffs increase the longer they are implemented:</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Response to Rebuttals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>“You don’t pay the tariff if you buy American!”</b> This is of course, nonsense. In reality, <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/nearly-all-imports-even-consumer-goods-are-inputs-for-us-firms-and-factories/">nearly all imports are inputs in domestic industry</a>, and <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/tariff-myths-debunked#">“around half of everything imported into the United States is stuff used by other U.S. manufacturers.”</a> So, you will pay the tariff even if you buy American, and domestic prices will rise.</li>
          <li><b>“Trade deficits are bad!”</b> Trade deficits are not bad. You have a trade deficit with your grocery store, barber, and dentist. And everyone understands that there is no problem with that. You buy their service because you value it at the price they’re selling it. It is completely irrelevant whether or not they reciprocate a purchase from you. So long as you are selling a different specialized service to someone, you have your income. The United States had a trade surplus <a href="https://cafehayek.com/2006/12/if_trade_surplu.html">during the Great Depression</a>, how did that work out?</li>
          <li><b>“If we produce everything domestically, all the money stays here!”</b> It is astounding that people, Republicans, are making these inane arguments in 2025. First, the United States will never produce certain goods and services as efficiently as other countries. Please try growing coffee domestically and compare it to the cost of growing it internationally. Second, there are not enough people in the United States to efficiently produce everything. There is already <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/manufacturing-faces-labor-shortage.html">a labor shortage in manufacturing</a>, so where are the hundred million Americans going to appear from to produce every product we currently consume? Third, when you pay $5 for a pair of internationally produced socks instead of $100 for 100% domestically produced socks, you save $95 that can be spent on actually efficient domestic industries, such as software. Protectionism cripples economies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Communists Hate Free-Trade</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Nikolai Bukharin was a Soviet communist who literally wrote <em>The ABC of Communism</em>. He was a staunch advocate for <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/13.htm">increasing tariffs</a>.</li>
