        <h2>Will there still be jobs?</h2>
        <p>According to an August 2025 Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans’ second biggest concern regarding artificial intelligence (AI) is the widespread loss of jobs (Lange & Alper, 2025). Whenever a new innovation emerges and disrupts existing industries, there is a reactionary force that attempts to halt the innovation’s adoption. For example, in the early 1800s, following the advent of mechanized textile manufacturing, textile craftsmen began attacking factories, as they were unable to compete with the cheaper, less time intensive industrial outputs (Andrews, 2015). These reactionaries are known as “Luddites” today, and the name is an epithet for those who oppose progress.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the Luddites were unsuccessful in turning the tides of history, the invisible hand of the market being too strong to conquer. While these craftsmen were displaced, and today there is a negligible amount of hand-made textiles in the US, this displacement did not result in a permanent gap in employment. Major labor upheavals are in fact the cyclical norm, and the US has already survived multiple significant changes.</p>
        <p>In 1790, 90% of the American population was employed in agriculture (National Park Service, 2022). In 2022, largely due to advances in technology enabling economies of scale, that number had dropped to 0.7% (Costa, 2023). Despite the employment sector changing for nearly all Americans, jobs are still abundant, and the latest numbers from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 7.4 million jobs are unfilled (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025).</p>
        <p>The tendency for innovation to disrupt the labor market, and for the labor market to reorient, is an essential component of free-market economics known as creative destruction. Creative destruction may lead to short-term economic losses for specific industries, but in the aggregate it propels the economy forward by enabling the labor market to shift to higher value roles. Mechanized production may have displaced the textile craftsmen, but it also enabled the mass production of computer components, empowering the masses to work productively from anywhere in the world, and learn about any subject, at any time of the day.</p>
        <p>Just as technological manufacturing specializes in automating repeatable tasks, AI specializes in automating prediction-making (Agrawal et al., 2018, p. 2). In the short term, this puts jobs that focus on performing predictable analysis most at risk, such as alert triaging in cybersecurity, as AI can predict the correct action at a high-enough rate, with greater speed, for it to be more cost-effective than hiring a full-time employee. Since AI reduces the need for rote review of predictable tasks, judgment becomes an increasingly valuable labor skill. Machine learning, a fundamental component of AI, is error-prone and “usually impossible to get perfect accuracy” (Gupta & Mangla, 2020, p. 103). Critical alerts and decisions are too impactful to be left to error-prone algorithms, and thus the skilled and experienced manual reviewer is more valuable.</p>
        <p>Overall, jobs are still needed in the short-term, and the history of labor markets has the common lesson that there will always be jobs, but those jobs may look radically different than they do today.</p>
